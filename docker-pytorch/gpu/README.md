# PyTorch GPU with PyTorch Transformer

The newest PyTorch Transformer is installed. For some reason, F1 score of NER with BERT gives really bad result with the newest PyTorch Transformer.

If you need BERT, please downgrade to version 0.4.0. Use "pip install pytorch-pretrained-bert==0.4.0" instead.
